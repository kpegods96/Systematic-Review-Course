# Module 3: Data Preparation and Descriptive Analysis 
<br>

Welcome to this module on data extraction and descriptive analysis in systematic reviews. In this session, you will learn how to move from raw study information to structured, analyzable datasets. We’ll practice identifying essential study characteristics, outcome measures, and effect sizes, and then converting them into formats suitable for statistical analysis. You will also gain skills in handling missing data, detecting errors and inconsistencies, and reducing potential bias. Finally, we’ll explore descriptive statistics and visualizations—such as summary tables, histograms, and boxplots—to identify data patterns and sources of variability. These skills will prepare you for effect size calculation and further analyses.

## Lesson 3.1: Handling Missing Data 

Hello and welcome! In this lecture, we’ll explore how to handle missing or incomplete data in systematic reviews—a common challenge that, if left unaddressed, can introduce bias and weaken conclusions. Our goal is to equip you with practical strategies to manage missing data effectively. You’ll learn about the risks of incomplete data, as well as techniques like mean imputation, last observation carried forward, and multiple imputation—essential tools for every evidence reviewer. We’ll also emphasize the importance of first contacting study authors to obtain missing information before applying these methods. Let’s dive in and build confidence in handling missing data.
