# Module 5: Assessing Bias and Heterogeneity

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

•	Utilize funnel plots, Egger’s test, and Begg’s test to detect potential publication bias.

•	Apply tools such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool or ROBINS-I to assess study quality.

•	Compute and interpret heterogeneity statistics, including Cochran’s Q, I², and Tau².

•	Investigate sources of heterogeneity by conducting subgroup.

•	Apply meta-regression techniques to explore potential moderators of heterogeneity.
