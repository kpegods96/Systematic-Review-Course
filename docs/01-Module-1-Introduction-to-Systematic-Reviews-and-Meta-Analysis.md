##	Lecture 1.1: Overview of Systematic Reviews

     
This lecture introduces the fundamentals of systematic reviews, a cornerstone of evidence-based research. You will learn what a systematic review is, why it is vital for synthesizing research, and how it informs decision-making across disciplines. We will cover the process and benefits of registering your study protocol to enhance transparency and minimize bias. The session will also introduce the PRISMA guidelines for transparent reporting, outline the essential steps in conducting a systematic review, and present AMSTAR-2, a widely used tool for assessing methodological quality. By the end, you will understand both the principles and practical steps for conducting rigorous reviews.

## Lecture 1.2: Importance, key concepts, and steps involved in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses


Welcome back! In this lecture, we explore the foundations of systematic reviews—their purpose, process, and role in evidence-based decision-making. We’ll begin with the pyramid of evidence, illustrating how study quality rises and risk of bias falls as we move upward. You’ll see how systematic reviews differ from traditional literature reviews, why they matter, and how they guide policy and practice. Using the 10,000 steps case study, we’ll examine how rigorous synthesis clarifies evidence, challenges assumptions, and informs recommendations. By the end, you’ll appreciate the systematic review’s power to produce transparent, high-quality conclusions that drive meaningful change.

## Lecture 1.3: Guide to registration of study protocol

It’s great if you already have a research question in mind. In this course, you’re not required to complete a full systematic review, but you’ll have the opportunity to follow along and learn the complete process. You can choose to apply these steps to your own topic or simply explore the examples we provide. In this lecture, we’ll guide you through the PROSPERO registration process, step by step. Preparation is key—while some fields are optional, completing certain sections will strengthen your protocol. We’ll highlight these essential areas so you can register with clarity, accuracy, and confidence.

Enjoy the walk through the PROSPERO protocol registration process now.

## Lecture 1.4: Guide to developing the PRISMA flowchart 

In this lecture, we will explore the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flowchart, a standardized tool used to document the study selection process in systematic reviews. The PRISMA flowchart helps ensure transparency by visually showing how many records were identified, screened, excluded, and ultimately included in the final analysis. We’ll walk through each step of the diagram, explaining its purpose and importance. Then, we’ll demonstrate how to generate a PRISMA flowchart in R using a dedicated package, enabling you to create reproducible, publication-ready diagrams directly from your review data.

## Lecture 1.5: Critical appraisal using AMSTAR 2

In this final lecture, we will focus on critical appraisal, a key step in assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews. We’ll introduce AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews), a widely recognized checklist designed to evaluate the reliability and rigor of reviews, especially those including randomized and non-randomized studies. You’ll learn how to apply AMSTAR 2 to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential biases. Finally, we’ll demonstrate how to use the AMSTAR2Vis package in R to visualize appraisal results, making them easier to interpret and share. This process ensures transparent, evidence-based conclusions for decision-making.
