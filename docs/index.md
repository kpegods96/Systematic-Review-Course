Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools for synthesizing research evidence and guiding evidence-based practice and policy. This course provides comprehensive training in conducting systematic reviews based on best practices. Participants will learn how to approach the process from start to finish, including formulating research questions (PICO framework), developing literature search strategies, extracting and preparing data, conducting descriptive analyses, performing meta-analyses using R, and reporting findings. The meta-analysis component focuses on statistical methods for combining study results, calculating effect sizes, assessing heterogeneity (I² statistic, subgroup analysis), and detecting publication bias (funnel plots, Egger’s test). The course also includes hands-on training with software such as R and Zotero and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students in Applied Health Sciences.

## Course outcome

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.	Define and differentiate systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and traditional literature reviews.

2.	Formulate focused and answerable research questions using the PICO framework.

3.	Design and execute structured search strategies using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library.

4.	Establish criteria for study selection and conduct unbiased screening using tools like PRISMA guidelines.

5.	Systematically collect relevant data from selected studies and assess study characteristics.

6.	Apply tools such as Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2), ROBINS-I for assessing study validity.

7.	Conduct statistical pooling of data, compute effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios, mean differences), and apply fixed/random effects models.

8.	Assess heterogeneity using I² statistics, conduct sensitivity analyses, and detect publication bias with funnel plots and Egger’s test.

9.	Gain hands-on experience with R (meta/metafor).

10.	Synthesize results, create forest plots, and write high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses following PRISMA guidelines.

11.	Explore subgroup analyses, meta-regression in meta-analysis.

12.	Address potential biases (publication bias), conflicts of interest, and ethical concerns in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
