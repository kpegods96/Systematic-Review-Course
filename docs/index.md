# Welcome!
<br>

This is the website for the **Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis** course, an initiative of the [**Lifetime Physical Activity Research Lab**](https://publish.illinois.edu/tassitanolab/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We believe the best way to learn is by teaching, and that learning is a collaborative journey between mentors and mentees. From start to finish, the development process was guided by this perspective. We hope that, along the way, you’ll take the opportunity to share your own insights and contribute to this community of learning. Your feedback is valued and will be acknowledged in future updates to the course. A feedback link is provided at the end of each module.

**Course Overview**



Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools for synthesizing research and guiding evidence-based practice and policy. This course provides comprehensive training in conducting systematic reviews based on best practices. Participants will learn how to approach the process from start to finish, including formulating research questions (PICO framework), developing literature search strategies, extracting and preparing data, conducting descriptive analyses, performing meta-analyses using R, and reporting findings. The meta-analysis component focuses on statistical methods for combining study results, calculating effect sizes, assessing heterogeneity (I² statistic, subgroup analysis), and detecting publication bias (funnel plots, Egger’s test). The course also includes hands-on training with software such as R and Zotero and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students in Applied Health Sciences.

Before we begin, we would like to provide some important guidance on how to engage with the material. If you are taking this course for instructional purposes, you are encouraged to follow along with the lectures and practice using the simulated examples provided. These will give you hands-on experience and help you understand the process of conducting a systematic review.

However, if you are enrolling with the intention of conducting your own systematic review, we recommend reaching out to us directly via email (**tassitano-lab@illinois.edu**) for additional support and guidance. It is also important to note that, at this time, the discussion component of the course is limited to members of the Illini Physical Activity Initiative. Finally, please keep in mind that the final project applies specifically to learners who are actively conducting their own systematic review.

We look forward to your participation and hope this course equips you with valuable skills and insights.

**Prerequisite**

Students should have R and RStudio installed on their computers and be familiar with basic R concepts, including running scripts, working with variables, and using functions. R can be downloaded [**here**](https://cran.r-project.org) and RStudio [**here**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download). A basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization in R is recommended. Helpful resources can be found here:

1. [Just some helpful first steps](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).

2. [RStudio “cheatsheets” for various of R packages and applications](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

3. [Data analysis and visualization in R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html).

4. [Reference for all new data science students](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

5. [Introductory statistics help](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf).

6. [Really useful for first-time students- tutorials that run directly in RStudio](https://swirlstats.com/).

**What you will learn**

***By the end of this course, you should be able to:***

1.	Define differentiate systematic review, meta-analysis, and other review types.

2.	Formulate focused and answerable research questions using the PICO framework.

3.	Design and execute structured search strategies using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library.

4.	Establish criteria for study selection and conduct unbiased screening using tools like PRISMA guidelines.

5.	Extract relevant data from selected studies and assess study characteristics.

6.	Apply tools such as Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2), ROBINS-I for assessing study validity.

7.	Conduct statistical pooling of data, compute effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios, mean differences), and apply fixed/random effects models.

8.	Assess heterogeneity using I² statistics, conduct sensitivity analyses, and detect publication bias with funnel plots and Egger’s test.

9.	Gain hands-on experience with R (meta/metafor).

10.	Synthesize results, create forest plots, and write high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses following PRISMA guidelines.

11.	Explore subgroup analyses, meta-regression in meta-analysis.

12.	Address potential biases (publication bias), conflicts of interest, and ethical concerns in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
