By the end of this module, you will be equipped with the skills to design and conduct a comprehensive literature search, construct precise search queries, and select the most relevant databases for your research. You will learn how to screen and filter results using clear eligibility criteria, manage citations in Zotero, and systematically extract data with standardized forms. We will also explore how to assess methodological quality, evaluate risk of bias, address common extraction issues, and ensure transparency through meticulous documentation of every step in your review process.



By the end of this module, students should be able to:

•	Explain the significance of a comprehensive literature search in systematic reviews and evidence-based research.

•	Construct effective search queries using Boolean operators, keywords, and subject headings.

•	Select appropriate databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) for conducting literature searches in health and social sciences.

•	Screen and filter search results based on predefined eligibility criteria.

•	Organize and manage citations using Zotero.

•	Systematically extract relevant data from selected studies using standardized forms and protocols.

## Lesson 2.1: The role of literature searches in systematic reviews

A systematic review is only as strong as the evidence it includes, and that evidence begins with a well-planned literature search. In this lecture, we will explore the pivotal role that literature searching plays in ensuring the completeness, accuracy, and credibility of a review. You will learn how a comprehensive search minimizes bias, captures relevant studies, and supports reproducibility. We will also discuss how search strategies connect directly to the review question, the choice of databases, and the transparency of reporting. By understanding this process, you’ll be better prepared to build a strong, reliable foundation for your systematic review.

## Lesson 2.2: Developing a search strategy with Boolean operators

An effective search strategy is the backbone of any systematic review, and mastering Boolean operators is key to finding the right evidence. In this lecture, we will explore how operators like AND, OR, and NOT can be used to combine keywords and subject headings for precise, comprehensive searches. Using a case study, you will learn how to structure search strings to balance sensitivity and specificity, ensuring you capture all relevant studies without being overwhelmed by irrelevant results. By the end, you’ll be able to search with confidence.

##	Lesson 2.3: Justifying database selection for research  

Choosing the right databases is a critical step in conducting a systematic review. In this lecture, we will explore how to justify your selection of databases based on the scope of your research question, the discipline, and the type of evidence you seek. You will learn to evaluate databases for coverage, content quality, and relevance, and understand why relying on a single source may lead to incomplete or biased results. By the end of this session, you’ll be able to provide a clear rationale for your database choices, ensuring that your literature search is comprehensive, transparent, and aligned with best practices in evidence-based research.

## Search Query Demonstration using PubMed

In this video, you will learn how to perform a systematic literature search using PubMed as a case study and how to export your results to a citation manager like Zotero. Following the demonstration, you are encouraged to run the same or your own search queries in other databases and record any differences in the number of results. This exercise will help you understand the scope and coverage of different databases, refine your search strategies, and build a strong, reproducible foundation for your systematic review.

## Lecture 2.4 – Use of Zotero

In this lecture, we will explore how to use Zotero, a powerful reference management tool, to organize your literature efficiently. You will learn how to import articles directly from databases, ensuring your references are captured accurately. We’ll also cover creating folders and subfolders to structure your library according to your review workflow, making it easier to track included and excluded studies. Additionally, you will learn how to rename main collections. Mastering these Zotero features will save time, enhance organization, and support a systematic, reproducible literature review.

## Lecture 2.5 – Duplicate Removal and Article Screening for Inclusion 

Welcome to this lecture on duplicate removal and article screening for inclusion in systematic reviews. These early steps are essential for creating an efficient and transparent review process. You will learn how to identify and remove duplicate records using reference management tools like Zotero, EndNote, or Covidence, ensuring each study is counted only once. We’ll then cover title and abstract screening to quickly assess study eligibility, followed by full-text screening for final inclusion decisions. You will also learn best practices for documenting every decision, which is critical for reproducibility and for creating a clear PRISMA flow diagram.

## Lecture 2.6 – Data extraction

Welcome to the Data Extraction Assignment lecture. In this session, you will learn how to systematically extract key information from research studies using a standardized data extraction form. Data extraction is essential for creating structured, consistent summaries that support accurate comparison and synthesis across studies. We will walk you through what to capture, including study identification, methods, population characteristics, outcomes, and key findings, and demonstrate how to organize this information efficiently, often using an Excel spreadsheet. You’ll also get practical guidance on designing your own extraction sheet and applying it to your included studies for hands-on experience.
