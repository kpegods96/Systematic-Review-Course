## Lesson 2.1: The role of literature searches in systematic reviews

A systematic review is only as strong as the evidence it includes, and that evidence begins with a well-planned literature search. In this lecture, we will explore the pivotal role that literature searching plays in ensuring the completeness, accuracy, and credibility of a review. You will learn how a comprehensive search minimizes bias, captures relevant studies, and supports reproducibility. We will also discuss how search strategies connect directly to the review question, the choice of databases, and the transparency of reporting. By understanding this process, you’ll be better prepared to build a strong, reliable foundation for your systematic review.

## Lesson 2.2: Developing a search strategy with Boolean operators

An effective search strategy is the backbone of any systematic review, and mastering Boolean operators is key to finding the right evidence. In this lecture, we will explore how operators like AND, OR, and NOT can be used to combine keywords and subject headings for precise, comprehensive searches. Using a case study, you will learn how to structure search strings to balance sensitivity and specificity, ensuring you capture all relevant studies without being overwhelmed by irrelevant results. By the end, you’ll be able to search with confidence.

## Lecture 2.7 – Critical Appraisal Assignment 

Hello everyone, and welcome! In this lecture, we’ll guide you through your Critical Appraisal assignment, an essential step in assessing the quality of studies for your systematic review. You’ll learn to evaluate risk of bias using two widely recognized tools: RoB 2 for randomized trials and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. As introduced in Module 1, other tools like AMSTAR 2 may be more suitable for certain study types, such as systematic reviews. By the end, you’ll be ready to critically appraise your included studies—or, if you’re here for informational purposes, apply these tools to five articles you’ve already found.
