# Module 5: Assessing Bias and Heterogeneity

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

•	Utilize funnel plots and Egger’s test to detect potential publication bias.

•	Investigate sources of heterogeneity by conducting subgroup.

•	Apply meta-regression techniques to explore potential moderators of heterogeneity.

**Wrap-up**

In this module, you explored advanced techniques in meta-analysis, with a focus on publication bias, moderator analysis, and subgroup analysis. You learned how to detect publication bias using funnel plots and assess it statistically with Egger’s regression test, enhancing your ability to evaluate the credibility of meta-analytic findings. Through guided exercises using a sample dataset in R, you gained practical experience in applying these techniques. You also conducted moderator and subgroup analyses to explore how different study-level factors—such as population characteristics or intervention types—can influence effect sizes and contribute to heterogeneity. With these advanced tools and skills, you are now equipped to apply them to your own systematic review, allowing you to draw more robust, nuanced, and generalizable conclusions.

**Looking ahead**

In the final module, you will learn how to effectively present the results of your meta-analysis to diverse audiences, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The module will cover best practices for translating statistical findings into clear, actionable messages that can inform policy and practice. You will also explore how to create dynamic, reproducible reports using R Markdown, integrating text, code, and visualizations to ensure transparency and replicability in your work.
