<li><h2 id="lesson-2.1-the-role-of-literature-searches-in-systematic-reviews">Lesson 2.1: The role of literature searches in systematic reviews</h2></li>
</ul>
<p>A systematic review is only as strong as the evidence it includes, and that evidence begins with a well-planned literature search. In this lecture, we will explore the pivotal role that literature searching plays in ensuring the completeness, accuracy, and credibility of a review. You will learn how a comprehensive search minimizes bias, captures relevant studies, and supports reproducibility. We will also discuss how search strategies connect directly to the review question, the choice of databases, and the transparency of reporting. By understanding this process, you’ll be better prepared to build a strong, reliable foundation for your systematic review.</p>

</ul>
<p>An effective search strategy is the backbone of any systematic review, and mastering Boolean operators is key to finding the right evidence. In this lecture, we will explore how operators like AND, OR, and NOT can be used to combine keywords and subject headings for precise, comprehensive searches. Using a case study, you will learn how to structure search strings to balance sensitivity and specificity, ensuring you capture all relevant studies without being overwhelmed by irrelevant results. By the end, you’ll be able to search with confidence.</p>

</ul>
<p>Choosing the right databases is a critical step in conducting a systematic review. In this lecture, we will explore how to justify your selection of databases based on the scope of your research question, the discipline, and the type of evidence you seek. You will learn to evaluate databases for coverage, content quality, and relevance, and understand why relying on a single source may lead to incomplete or biased results. By the end of this session, you’ll be able to provide a clear rationale for your database choices, ensuring that your literature search is comprehensive, transparent, and aligned with best practices in evidence-based research.</p>
