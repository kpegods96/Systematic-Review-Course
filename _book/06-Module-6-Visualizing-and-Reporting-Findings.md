# Module 6: Visualizing and Reporting Findings 

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

•	Organize and present key meta-analysis findings using structured tables and visualizations.

•	Interpret and Communicate Results Clearly – Translate statistical findings into meaningful insights for diverse audiences, including researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.

•	Structure meta-analysis reports according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standards.

•	Implement R Markdown to create dynamic, reproducible reports integrating text, code, and outputs.

## Lecture 6.1: Meta - Analysis Result Presentation

Welcome! In this session, we’ll focus on how to summarize and present meta-analysis results using structured tables and clear visuals. Communicating findings effectively is just as important as conducting the analysis itself—because strong evidence must be both rigorous and accessible. We’ll cover best practices for reporting, including how to design summary tables that highlight study characteristics and effect sizes, and how to use visuals like forest plots and funnel plots to convey overall patterns and potential bias. By the end, you’ll know how to transform complex statistical outputs into compelling, transparent presentations that resonate with your audience.

## Lecture 6.2: Communicating Meta-Analysis Results for Policy Impact

Welcome! In this video, we’ll explore how to translate complex meta-analysis results into clear, actionable messages for non-technical audiences such as policymakers, public health practitioners, and community stakeholders. While statistical outputs are valuable to researchers, decision-makers need evidence that is understandable, relevant, and directly tied to practice or policy. A well-crafted policy brief bridges this gap by simplifying complex findings, avoiding jargon, and focusing on real-world implications. By the end of this session, you’ll understand how to tailor results for different audiences, use visuals effectively, and frame key takeaways that guide informed action and meaningful change.

## Lecture 6.3: Reproducible Reporting with R Markdown

Welcome! In this video, we’ll focus on how to create dynamic, reproducible reports using R Markdown, an essential skill for systematic review analysis in public health and research. R Markdown allows you to seamlessly integrate text, code, and outputs into a single document, ensuring your work is both transparent and easy to share. By combining narrative with automatically updated plots, tables, and results, you can produce professional reports that are reproducible across different contexts. In this session, you’ll learn the structure of an R Markdown report, best practices for embedding analysis, and how to render polished outputs for submission.
