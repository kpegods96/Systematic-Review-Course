It covers systematic review methodologies, including formulating research questions (PICO framework), literature search strategies, data extraction, and quality assessment using risk of bias tools. The meta-analysis component focuses on statistical methods for combining study results, effect size calculation, heterogeneity assessment (I² statistic, subgroup analysis), and publication bias detection (funnel plots, Eggers test). The course also includes hands-on training with software such as R and Zotero. Applied in fields like medicine, epidemiology, and public health, this course is essential for researchers aiming to synthesize evidence and inform policy. 1.1 Course outcome By the end of this course, students will be able to: Define and differentiate systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and traditional literature reviews. Formulate focused and answerable research questions using the PICO framework. Design and execute structured search strategies using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Establish criteria for study selection and conduct unbiased screening using tools like PRISMA guidelines. Systematically collect relevant data from selected studies and assess study characteristics. Apply tools such as Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2), ROBINS-I for assessing study validity. Conduct statistical pooling of data, compute effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios, mean differences), and apply fixed/random effects models. Assess heterogeneity using I² statistics, conduct sensitivity analyses, and detect publication bias with funnel plots and Eggers test. Gain hands-on experience with R (meta/metafor). Synthesize results, create forest plots, and write high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses following PRISMA guidelines. Explore subgroup analyses, meta-regression in meta-analysis. Address potential biases (publication bias), conflicts of interest, and ethical concerns in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
