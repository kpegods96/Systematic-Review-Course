# Module 3: Data Preparation and Descriptive Analysis 

By the end of this module, students should be able to:

•	Recognize and extract essential study characteristics, outcome measures, and effect sizes from included studies.

•	Convert extracted data into structured formats suitable for statistical analysis.

•	Apply appropriate techniques to address missing or incomplete data in systematic reviews.

•	Detect and resolve inconsistencies, errors, and potential biases in the extracted data.

•	Compute measures of central tendency, variability, and frequency distributions for key study variables.

•	Generate summary tables, histograms, boxplots, and other graphical representations to illustrate data patterns.

•	Use descriptive analysis to explore potential sources of variability across studies.

•	Format data for effect size calculations, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity testing.
